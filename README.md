# Quiz-Code

## Description 
This is a Spongebob Trivia quiz. It's all about Sponebob and his friends. You are given 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible. Each question you  get wrong it subtracts 5 seconds. Now it does end the quiz at zero but currenlty the leaderboards isn't made or functional yet. But your socre is stored in the local storage so if you do want to see what you got you can look in there for now. Styling was a little challenging I tried to do color scheme of patrick and spongebob. But still a fun Trivia for Spongebob and friends.
